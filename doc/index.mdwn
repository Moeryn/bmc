BMC stands for Braille Music Compiler.  It aims to become an universal
translator between various visual music notation formats and braille music code.
At the moment, it can convert certain braille music code to LilyPond, which
can later be converted (using LilyPond) to PDF and/or MIDI.

This is a list of braille music code features that BMC already supports:

* Full and partial measure in-accord.
* Ambiguity resolution (automatic value deduction including support for value distinction signs).
* Notegroupings (decoded and emitted as beams in visual notation).
* Section-by-section solo and keyboard music (parts with one or two staves).
* Partial support for simile signs (full and partial measure repetition).

The following is a list of braille music code features which are currently not yet supported by BMC:

* Tuplets.
* Doubling.
* Repeated ranges of measures.
* Polymetric music (music on staves with different time signatures).
* Bar-over-bar format.
