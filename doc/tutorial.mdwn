# Notes and rests

## Notes

The signs used for notes follow a certain system.  The note name
is encoded in the upper 4 braille dots.  Braille letter d through j are
used to indicate the note name.  Dots 3 and 6 can be added
to indicate the note value.  If none of dot 3 or 6 are present, a 8th or
128th note is given.  If dot 3 is added, we are dealing with either
a half or 32th note.  If dot 6 is added, we are dealing with a quarter
or 64th note.  Finally, if both dot 3 and dot 6 are added, we have a
whole or 16th note.

For people coming from a cultural background where notes are named like
C, D, E, F, G, A and B (english speaking countries) or C, D, E, F, G, A, H (german
speaking countries) you might have a hard time at first to read note names.
However, there is a trick for memorizing.  Observe that the braille letters
used to indicate note names are shifted up by one letter.  So the note C
is written with the braille letter d, the note D is written with the braille letter e and so on.
The two exceptions here are the note names A and B (or H).  A is written
with the braille letter i, and B (or H) is written with the braille letter j.

| Sign |    Description    |
|:----:|:----------------- |
| ⠙    | 8th or 128th C    |
| ⠑    | 8th or 128th D    |
| ⠋    | 8th or 128th E    |
| ⠛    | 8th or 128th F    |
| ⠓    | 8th or 128th G    |
| ⠊    | 8th or 128th A    |
| ⠚    | 8th or 128th B    |
| ⠝    | half or 32th C    |
| ⠕    | half or 32th D    |
| ⠏    | half or 32th E    |
| ⠟    | half or 32th F    |
| ⠗    | half or 32th G    |
| ⠎    | half or 32th A    |
| ⠞    | half or 32th B    |
| ⠹    | quarter or 64th C |
| ⠱    | quarter or 64th D |
| ⠫    | quarter or 64th E |
| ⠻    | quarter or 64th F |
| ⠳    | quarter or 64th G |
| ⠪    | quarter or 64th A |
| ⠺    | quarter or 64th B |
| ⠽    | whole or 16th C   |
| ⠵    | whole or 16th D   |
| ⠯    | whole or 16th E   |
| ⠿    | whole or 16th F   |
| ⠷    | whole or 16th G   |
| ⠮    | whole or 16th A   |
| ⠾    | whole or 16th B   |

## Rests

There are four signs used to show rest values.  As with note values,
each sign can have two meanings.

| Sign |     Description      |
|:----:|:-------------------- |
| ⠍    | whole or 16th rest   |
| ⠥    | half or 32th rest    |
| ⠧    | quarter or 64th rest |
| ⠭    | 8th or 128th rest    |

## Octave signs

Contrary to engraved music where clef signs determine the pitch of a note, braille music uses octave signs to indicate the exact pitch of a note.

An octave sign is placed directly in front of a note sign, without any other signs in between.
The following example shows octave signs 1 through 7 placed in front of a quarter C.

There has to be an octave sign in front of the first note of a piece.
For all following notes these rules apply:

* If the following note goes a second or third up or down it does not need an octave sign.
* If it goes a fourth or fifth up or down it receives an octave sign only if it is in a different octave then the previous note.
* With an interval of a sixth or greater to the previous note, it always receives an octave sign.

These rules are shown in the following example.

# Rhythmic notegroups

In engraved music one or several beams are often used to connect smaller notes
across or as part of a beat.  One beam is used for 8th notes, two beams for
16th notes, and so on.
This kind of grouping is also done, to a certain extend, in braille music code.

Three or more 16th notes (but also smaller values) can be grouped in braille
music.  One group of notes should not be part of two different beats.
The first note is written with the real value of the group, while the remaining
notes are written as 8th notes.

Notegrouping is also legal if it is started with a rest of the same value as the
other notes in the group.
However, rests are not allowed to appear anywhere else in a notegroup.
