We have a very rudimentary, but probably quite useful, web interface to BMC now.
That means, you can enter braille music code in your web browser and have it processed
by BMC to produce visual and aural renditions of your braille music.

This is a first step to get the features we support already out to users.
While BMC is quite easy to compile and install on Linux and probably Mac OS X,
we haven't really amanged to make any progress on a Windows or iOS/Android port
recently.  So while I actually envisage even more fine-grained interactive
features in the future, a web service is actually a useful start to bridge
the cross-platform divide.

You can find the current version of bmc.cgi [here](http://bmc.delysid.org/).

Additionally, links have been placed in the [tutorial](../tutorial/) which allow to
expand on the provided examples using this new web service.

Concerning the backend, I have made BMC compliant with another braille
music rule.  A note group can never span across a music hyphen.  Since music
hyphens were previously parsed, but ignored in the AST, this had to be changed.
A Music hyphen is now saved in the internal AST, and can be queried to
stop note group search.
