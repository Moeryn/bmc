While working with bwv988 variation 16, BMC just found yet another error
in the original transcription to braille.  Consider the following measure, in 3/8 time (G, one sharp):

    ⠨⠺⠄⠈⠉⠣⠜⠐⠺⠩⠙⠩⠑⠋⠁⠛⠇⠑⠃

Once alerted to it by BMC's value disambiguation algorithm, this one is actually
easy to spot and fix.  There is just one dot missing.  Can you see which one it is?

The first voice is rather clear, it consists of a dotted quarter note, which means it matches 3/8 time signature.
If we follow whats written in braille, the second voice consists of either
6 64th notes, or a 64th note followed by 5 8th notes.  Both possibilities make
no sense, and do not match the length of the other voice.
So BMC rightly barfs and reports this as a measure with no possible interpretations.

The fix is, as already said, rather simple:

    ⠨⠺⠄⠈⠉⠣⠜⠐⠾⠩⠙⠩⠑⠋⠁⠛⠇⠑⠃

Now the second voice is a notegroup of 6 16th notes, which makes sense, and parses fine as unambiguous.

BMC found actually *two* outright errors in the original transcription of this variation already.
This is a rather nice demonstration that BMC can be very helpful as a proof-reading tool for transcribers, humans and computers, alike.
