Today, BMC found its first real error in a book of braille music.
I am anticipating this event since at least a year, when I first started to realize the potential of automated validation of braille music code.
However, its something different when you finally see it really happening!

Consider the following measure of music, in 4/4 time (in G, one sharp):

    ((>h_eaflg{gh(il<+w"cj"ctsarq

At first, when BMC refused to accept this, I was already searching for a programming error.
Until I realized that the measure given is really invalid.

In print, the first two beats are beamed 16th notes.  The transcriber
used a notegroup for the 16th notes on the second beat.  But they apparently
forgot to put dots 3 and 6 on the first 16th G.

The correct measure is:

    ((>{_eaflg{gh(il<+w"cj"ctsarq

Now that the first notegroup is correct, BMC can infer that all note durations
match up with a time signature of 4/4.
