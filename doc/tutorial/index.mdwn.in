# Notes and rests

## Notes

The signs used for notes follow a certain system.  The note name
is encoded in the upper 4 braille dots.  Braille letter d through j are
used to indicate the note name.  Dots 3 and 6 can be added
to indicate the note value.  If none of dot 3 or 6 are present, a 8th or
128th note is given.  If dot 3 is added, we are dealing with either
a half or 32th note.  If dot 6 is added, we are dealing with a quarter
or 64th note.  Finally, if both dot 3 and dot 6 are added, we have a
whole or 16th note.

For people coming from a cultural background where notes are named like
C, D, E, F, G, A and B (english speaking countries) or C, D, E, F, G, A, H (german
speaking countries) you might have a hard time at first to read note names.
However, there is a trick for memorizing.  Observe that the braille letters
used to indicate note names are shifted up by one letter.  So the note C
is written with the braille letter d, the note D is written with the braille letter e and so on.
The two exceptions here are the note names A and B (or H).  A is written
with the braille letter i, and B (or H) is written with the braille letter j.

## Rests

There are four signs used to show rest values.  As with note values,
each sign can have two meanings.

| Sign |     Description      |
|:----:|:-------------------- |
| ⠍    | whole or 16th rest   |
| ⠥    | half or 32th rest    |
| ⠧    | quarter or 64th rest |
| ⠭    | 8th or 128th rest    |

## Octave signs

An octave sign is placed directly in front of a note sign, without any other signs in between.
The following example shows octave signs 1 through 7 placed in front of a quarter C.
